# The Dilithium Project

_The Dilithium Project_ is a set of tooling that supports the development of high-performance internet protocols.

Initially, we're focusing on the development of `westworld2` and `westworld3`, which are high-performance streaming protocols designed to maximize throughput across wide-area network links.

_Dilithium_ feeds into the [OpenZiti](https://github.com/openziti]) project, in support of it's high-performance _Transwarp_ data plane implementation.
