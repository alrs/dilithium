# Westworld2 "Loopback 1" Profile
#
# This is a Westworld2 tuning designed for maximum performance on loopback links.
#

# Start with 2 gigabyte portal.
#
tx_portal_start_sz:           2147483648

# Set the portal size floor to 16k.
#
# We probably don't want to handle portal sizes any lower than this. It might even be smart to increase this by an order
# of magnitude for any reasonably performant internet link.
#
tx_portal_min_sz:             16384

# 2 gigabytes.
#
tx_portal_max_sz:             2147483648

# Increase the portal size after 1 successfully-acked packets.
#
tx_portal_increase_ct:        1

# Increase the portal by 2x.
#
tx_portal_increase_frac:      2.0

# Decrease the portal size after 256 duplicate acks.
#
tx_portal_dup_ack_ct:         256

# Change the portal size by this fraction when the duplicate ack threshold is reached.
#
# So, every 256 duplicate acks, we reduce the portal size to 99.99% of its current size.
#
tx_portal_dup_ack_frac:       0.9999

# Decrease the portal size after 128 retransmission events.
#
tx_portal_retx_ct:            128

# After every 128 retransmission events, we reduce the portal size to 99.99% of its current size.
#
tx_portal_retx_frac:          0.9999

# When the connection is first established, we haven't yet done an RTT probe. So, just guess that the RTT is probably
# something like 5ms (the floor).
#
retx_start_ms:                5

# Add 3 milliseconds to whatever the RTT probe finds the RTT to be.
#
retx_add_ms:                  3

# We don't need to probe very often on loopback.
#
rtt_probe_ms:                 250

# Smooth the probed RTT value over the last 4 samples.
#
rtt_probe_avg_ct:             4

# ~64k "jumbo" frames.
#
max_segment_sz:               63500

# RX and TX buffer sizes for the underlying socket. 8mb.
